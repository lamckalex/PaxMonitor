Check pax site for when tickets go on sale

This is a desktop application that checks the pax website for any changes to their tickets status.
Testing: I have it configured for 2014 summer pax, and it is confirmed to work as I made a dummy site and pointed it to that.
Results: It spammed my email all morning when the pax tickets went on sale and I overslept.

Will update for this year's pax!
